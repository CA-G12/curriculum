### Overview

A good ePortfolio is evidence of learning and performance that takes years to complete. It is your online facade as a learner and a programer, and is meant to showcase your strengths and areas of growth.

**A good start is the development of a website that contains the following webpages:**

**a. About me:** On this page, learners share their images, videos or other forms of identity they are comfortable with – including an avatar. Learners talk about themselves. They explain their current professional status and their aspirations for the future.

**b. Skills and Projects:** This page can have links to projects and samples of technical skills (for example, Photoshop projects etc.) that the learner has completed over the years.

**c. CV:** On this page, the learner uploads their CV to give their readers a complete idea of their background.

**d. Reflections and Aspirations:** Here, learners can write down their observations on their performance and their lessons learned.

**e. Inspiration: learners can provide a person they look up to and why they do so, it could also be things that inspire you, specific websites they love to visit, quotes, instruments, anything.**

### Task

In your rooms, get to know your peer and make sure you use the coming 30 mins to get enough information on the above sections so you're able to build them an ePortfolio.

_Take lots of notes and keep them handy cause we'll need them throughout the week ;)_

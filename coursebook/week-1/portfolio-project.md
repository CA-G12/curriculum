## Project

### Build a one-page portfolio website for you and your team

We want you to work together over the next few days to build a small site from scratch that provides a short portfolio for you and your team.

To describe what features should be implemented, these are the [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) that should be satisfied;

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**

> I want to **visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team**

> So that I **get a concise description of what you have to offer me**.

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**

> I want to **visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact'**

> so I can **quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.**

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**

> I want to **be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information**

> So that **the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards**

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**

> I want to **click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page**

> So that I **can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.**

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**

> I want to **easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop**

> so that I **can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in.**

As a **visually impaired client...**

> I would like to **easily read and understand the text on your site**

> so I can **understand the information available**

As a **blind client...**

> I would like to **easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site**

> so I can **understand the information available**.

## Build Process (Days 3 and 4)

Your team needs to set up a new repository under your cohort's Github organisation and work together over the next few days to commit changes to this repository.

Your repo should contain a README file with these three points -

* WHY (describing the purpose)
* WHAT (describing your site)
* HOW (describing the journey to completion)

You may also add more ambitious features in the README which describes **stretch goals**. Feel free to add the user stories from this project guide into your README too.

When working together, groups should split into pairs to complete project tasks, making sure they are constantly communicating with each other. **Please note that although in the [git workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/git-workflow-workshop-for-two) you were instructed to work in pairs and merge each other's pull requests, as you're working in teams of four now, you will be merging the other pair's pull requests!**

However you decide to individualise your site is up to you, but aim to satisfy the user stories.

Your blog should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your _Linkedin_, _Github_ and _Codewars_ accounts.

## Publishing (Before 5PM Day 4)

* On completion, your site should be published via _github pages_. You may decide to publish early (perhaps to check how it looks on mobile?)
* Your README should also include a link to the live site (you can also add a direct link next to the description at the top of your repo, so that others can clearly find your live site).

## Tips

* Try drawing out rough sketches of your site first and agree on a design to work towards throughout the project
* Adding issues to your github repo is highly recommended, so you can easily keep track of what needs to be done/resolved, and who should be responsible.
* You ~~may~~ will encounter merge conflicts when working together on the same files. Don't panic, discuss the conflicts with your team before reaching a resolution.
* If you decide to use and stick to a particular naming convention for your CSS classes before starting the project then that's awesome! At the very least, aim to organise your CSS rules so they grouped together well and use clear descriptive class names.
* Ensure your site is accessible. We will be checking your site for it's accessibility coverage by using [a variety of accessibility tools](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility#tools-that-can-help).
* You should consider installing the Prettier plugin (code formatter) in your editors to ensure your team code is consistent. An easy step by step guide can be found here: https://prettier.io/.

**Note: You should stop working on your profile after 5PM on day 4. This prevents someone from writing code which the other members of the team might not have seen before you present your project and allows everybody to be on the same wavelength.**

**On the morning of day 5, you'll be swapping code with another team and raising issues on their code, before resolving issues that you have received.**

**You will present your project to the rest of the cohort on the afternoon of day 5, so aim to factor in at least 15 minutes on day 4 to discuss how you will present your work.**

**Also, if you don't manage to complete the project, or if it doesn't work by the time it comes to presenting- don't fear! You should aim to present your progress to the rest of the cohort, not a fully polished finished site.**

**When stuck on a problem you should follow the 20-20-20 rule, this means you should try to spend 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with your partner, then 20 minutes trying to solve the problem in your team, then 20 minutes trying to solve it as a class. If that fails bring your problem to a mentor. They will be happy to help**

**Good luck :)**

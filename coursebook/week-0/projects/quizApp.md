## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

**Create a GitHub repo on G11 org and use `git` command to push your code, `Don't push to master` also deploy it to `Github pages`.**


User Stories:

1. As a User, I want to be able to open the app page and see a brief description of the game and how to play.
2. As a User, I should be able to check the leaderboard that contains the high score with the name of the players.
3. As a User, I should have a button to start the game.
4. The game should ask the player to enter his/her name.
5. The game should give 10 random MC questions to the user with 4 options to each question(only one right answer).
6. As a User, I want to have a button to move to the next question after answering the current question.
7. The next question button should only appear/activate after answering the question.
8. As a User, I should be able to see how many questions I still have to answer(2/10 meaning that I am on the second question).
9. As a User, I should be able to see my score after finishing all of the questions.

> You should use `local storage` for this project to save the questions and the leaderboard.
